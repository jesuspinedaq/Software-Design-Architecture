## Architectural pattern vs Architectural Style vs Design Pattern



### Architectural Styles:
- Client-Server
- Layered architecture:
    - Clean architecture
    - Hexagonal architecture
- Master slave
- Pipe filter
- Monolite
- Microservices
- Brocker
- Peer-to-Peer
- Even bus pattern
- Model View Controller pattern (MVC)
- Blackboard pattern
- Interpreter

### Architectural Patterns
- Polling
- Webhook
- WebSocket

### [Architectural Anti-Patterns](ArchitecturalAnti-Patterns/ArchitecturalAnti-Patterns.md)
- Sinkhole anti-pattern

### [Design Patterns](DesignPatterns/DesignPattern.md)
- Behavior patterns
- Structurals patterns
- Creationals patterns

### Good software architecture indicator:
- The software is easy to maintain
- Busines stake holdes understand the architecture
- Usable in long-term
- Flexible, adaptable, extensible
- Scalability
- Easy to add new features
- No code repetitions
- Easy to refactor

### SOLID Principles
- Single responsibility
- Open close principle
- Liskov sutitution
- Interface segregation
- Dependency Inversion of control

### Other principles
- DRY: Donâ€™t repeat yourself
- YGN: You gonna needed
- KISS: Keep it simple stupid
- SoC: Separation of concerns

### Other topics:
- Code Naming
- Code review
- Functional programming
